1.UNDERSTANDING WI-FI USB DONGLES

A WI-FI USB dongle also known as a WI-FI adaptapter, is a small device
that connects to a computer or other device via a UBS port to provide wireless
internet connectivity.It's essentially a wireless network adaptapter that alllows 
devices without built-in WI-FI capabilities to connect to available WI-FI networks.
If your laptop, desktop, or other device doesn't have a built-in Wi-Fi card, a Wi-Fi
USB dongle allows you to connect to wireless networks. It transmits and receives Wi-Fi 
signals, allowing your device to communicate with nearby Wi-Fi routers. 

2. SECURE COLLABORATION ACROSS THE INTERNET

Secure collaboration across the internet involves using platforms and practices that protect
sensitive information during online teamwork. This includes employing encrypted communication channels,
secure file sharing, and multi-factor authentication, while also educating users on safe online practices. 
Using tools that encrypt data both in transit and at rest to prevent unauthorized access. Utilizing platforms
 with features like digital rights management, access controls, and audit trails to protect sensitive documents.
 Choosing platforms designed with security in mind, such as those offering end-to-end encryption and robust access
 controls. 

 3.TYPES AND FUNCTIONS OF NETWORK AND WIRELESS CONNECTION

 Wireless networks serve multiple crucial functions, including: Data Exchange: Facilitate the transmission and sharing
 of data between devices without needing physical connections. Mobility: Enable devices to connect and communicate while
 on the move, providing flexibility and supporting mobile workforces.

 *LAN (Local Area Network) – 
Systems connected in a small network like in a building or a small office
It is inexpensive
It uses Ethernet or Token-ring technology
Two or more personal computers can be connected through wires or cables acting as nodes
Transfer of data is fast and is highly score

*PAN (Personal Area Network) – 
The smallest computer network
Devices may be connected through Bluetooth or other infra-red enables devices
It has a connectivity range of upto 10 metres
It covers an area of upto 30 feet
Personal devices belonging to a single person can be connected to each other using PAN

*MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) – 
A network that can be connected within a city, for example, cable TV Connection
It can be in the form of Ethernet, ATM, Token-ring and FDDI
It has a higher range
This type of network can be used to connect citizens with the various Organisations

*WAN (Wide Area Network) – 
A network which covers over a country or a larger range of people
Telephonic lines are also connected through WAN
Internet is the biggest WAN in the world
Mostly used by Government Organisations to manage data and information

*VPN (Virtual Private Network): – 
A network which is constructed by using public wires to connect to a private network
There are a number of systems which enable you to create networks using the Internet as a medium for transporting data
These systems use encryptions and other security mechanisms to ensure only authorised users can access

4. DESCRIPTION OF THE COMMMON FUNCTIONALITY OF SERVER NETWORKS

Server networks handle a variety of functions essential to modern computing, primarily focusing on 
centralized data management and resource sharing within a network. These functions include data storage
and retrieval, managing network traffic, providing services like web hosting and email, and ensuring security
and efficient resource allocation.
